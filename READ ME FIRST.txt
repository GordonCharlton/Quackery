Quackery consists of the files and folders in the folder named
quackery in which you find this file.

In addition to this text file, you should find three pdf files, namely;

The Book of Quackery.pdf             the Quackery manual
The Book of Quackery for print.pdf   as above, but prints better
Quackery Quick Reference.pdf         a handy crib sheet

and four text files;

quackery.py      the Quackery language coded in Python 3
extensionsX.qky  a file of Quackery code
bigrat.qky       another file of Quackery code
turtleduck.qky   and another file of Quackery code

and a folder called sundry, containing four more files of Quackery
code;

cards.qky
demo.qky
fsm.qky
heapsort.qky

You will require a copy of Python3, version 3.5 or better, on your
system. As a quick test navigate to the quackery folder in your
Terminal app and enter either

python quackery.py sundry/demo.qky

or

python3 quackery.py sundry/demo.qky

One or both of these should a few screenfuls of output. If both
produce an error message, you probably need to install or upgrade
Python 3 on your system. More details about running Quackery can be
found in The Book of Quackery.
